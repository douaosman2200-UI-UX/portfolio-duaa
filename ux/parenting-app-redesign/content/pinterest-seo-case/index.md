# Parenting App Flow Redesign
**Role:** UX Designer | **Tools:** Figma, Pen & Paper | **Timeframe:** 2 weeks  

## Problem
Parents struggled with the bedtime routine tracker — too many steps, unclear buttons.

## Process
- Reviewed 3 parent feedback interviews  
- Created wireframes for a simpler “3-step” flow  
- Tested with 2 moms: success rate improved  

## Before/After
*(Add screenshots here later)*  

## Outcome
Clearer, shorter bedtime flow. Parents felt “less stressed.”
