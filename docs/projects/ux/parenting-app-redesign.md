# Parenting App Flow Redesign
**Role:** UX Designer | **Tools:** Figma, Pen & Paper | **Timeframe:** 2 weeks

## Problem & Audience
Parents struggled with the bedtime routine tracker — too many steps, unclear buttons.

## Constraints & Success Criteria
Mobile-first; reduce steps and make the primary action obvious. Success = fewer taps, fewer backtracks.

## Research / Audit
- 3 parent interviews: confusion around starting/stopping timers
- Heuristic review: visibility of system status + error prevention issues
- Icon labels unclear

## IA / Flows
- Old: Home → Routines → Bedtime → Steps (6) → Done
- New: Home → **Start Bedtime** (3 grouped steps) → Done

## Wireframes → High-Fidelity
_Add screenshots later (before/after). Explain what changed and why._

## Usability Notes
Two moms tested the new flow; both completed without help and described it as “clearer” and “faster.”

## Outcome & Next Steps
Reduced steps from 6 to 3; clearer CTA. Next: add progress indicator and confirm/cancel microcopy.
